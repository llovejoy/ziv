		"approach": "<p>Taking their existing screens and user flows, we created three distinct looks to provide a fresh vision for the system. Once an approach was selected we applied that to their interface, along with fresh iconography and restructured pages.</p>",

		"approach": "<p>Creating a family of identities that worked both individually and as a system, we capitalized on existing brand aspects. For St. Andrew’s Golf Course it was the lion we then modernized, and for the Sykes Lady Golf Course it was taking the word Sykes (meaning by the water) and fashioning an oak leaf that was created using the shape of the in-course bodies of water.</p>",
